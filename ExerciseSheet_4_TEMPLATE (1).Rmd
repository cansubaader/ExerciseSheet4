## General Remarks

-   You can submit your solutions in teams of up to 3 students.

-   Include all your team-member's names and student numbers
    (Martrikelnummern) in the `authors` field.

-   Please use the exercise template document to work on and submit your
    results.

-   Use a level 2 heading for each new exercise and answer each subtask
    next to it's bullet point or use a new level 3 heading if you want.

-   Always render the R code for your solutions and make sure to include
    the resulting data in your rendered document.

-   Submit your solution in a HTML file

-   Make sure to not print more than 10 rows of data (unless
    specifically instructed to).

-   Always submit both the rendered document(s) as well as your source
    Rmarkdown document. Submit the files separately on moodle, **not**
    as a zip archive.

-   **NEW**: Make sure to submit you render your Rmarkdown as
    `distill:distill_article` and check the final output regarding any
    issues in formatting. Formatting errors may lead to point
    deductions.

# Planning a hiking trip in the alps!

## Exercise 1: Finding the alps (4 Points)

We want to plan a hiking trip in the Alps and want to use geospatial
data science tools to help us with the planning. We will use the R
packages `{osmdata}` and `{tmap}` for this.

a)  Start by getting the bounding box for the `"Alps"` using the
    appropriate function from `{osmdata}`.
```{r}

```


b)  Adjust the function to return a `sf_polygon` and plot it using
    `{tmap}` to check whether it is correct. Use the function
    `tm_borders` to plot just its outline.

-   Use the correct argument to plot the borders in `"darkgreen"`
-   Copy your plotting code and use it with the two different options
    for `tmap_mode()` to have one interactive version and one
    non-interactive version

c)  Briefly describe the pros and cons of interactive maps and
    non-interactive maps based on the example you created in b) with one
    sentence each. `print_points(1)`

d)  It seems the whole alps are a big too big, so let's just focus on
    the `"Dolimites"`. Retrieve a bounding box for the Dolomites and
    plot it's outline to check whether it's correct.

## Exercise 2: Finding Accommodation (5 Points)

We want to sleep in some remote places (without staff or restaurants) on
our hike, so let's find some using OpenStreetMaps.

a)  Search for the correct tag to identify *wilderness huts* in
    OpenStreetMaps. Write down the tag below and add the URL to its
    OSMWiki page.

b)  Create the correct OSM query in {osmdata} and execute it to download
    a list of all wilderness huts in the Dolomites. Use a bounding box
    for the `"Dolomites"`, but be sure to use the correct format
    (`sf_polygon` does not work with queries).

c)  How many wilderness huts are there in the Dolomites?

> Hint: If you have trouble working with the result, look at the
> different types of result in there. We're only interested in
> osm_points here.

d)  Since these are slightly more huts than expected, let's only look at
    the ones that have names. Filter the result to only include huts
    with names (column `name`). How many huts are there with names?

e)  Use `tm_dots` to plot the remaining huts on an **interactive** map.

-   Color the dots based on the elevation of the hut (you may need to
    convert the column `ele` for this to work properly)
-   Use the hut's name as id on the map to see it when hovering the dots

f)  We're all done! Lastly, select one of the huts that you find
    appealing and return only its row in the data. What's the name of
    the hut you chose and what is its elevation?

## Exercise 3: It's coming home (6 Points)

In this exercise you will analyze and visualize some datasets, that
contain information on every professional football match played in the
UK since 1888. You can access the data via this GitHub repository:
<https://github.com/jfjelstul/englishfootball>

a)  Load the `{matches.csv}` file from the `{data}` folder. Visualize
    how the number of total goals scored per game has evolved over time.
    Create a nice and complete plot and interpret what you see in one or
    two sentences.

b)  Load the `{standings.csv}` dataset. Run a linear regression model,
    that has the final rank of a team at the end of a season as
    dependent variable. Include at least three independent variables,
    that make sense to include. Interpret two coefficients
    statistically.

c)  From the `{matches.csv}` do the following calculations and present
    your results in a table:

1.  Which team has the most wins, losses and draws?
2.  Which team played the most league games in the data?
3.  Which team has the best/worst win percentage?
4.  How many points did Manchester United get each season they were
    featured in the data? (For simplification: Win = 3 points, Draw = 1,
    Loss = 0)
